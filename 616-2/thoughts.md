This round just felt really weird. I thought A and B were pretty straightforward, C took a bit of thinking (and half-sleeping) but also was otherwise not too bad. Then suddenly there's a big jump to D, where I couldn't even figure out what was going on really. I got like halfway through my thinking but even then it seemed just weird.

I thought the B solution was pretty clean, actually. Just notice that any increasing sequence starting at the first index really can be just transformed into 0, 1, 2, etc. So check if the first n numbers can be reduced into this sequence, then check if it can be done starting at the end (for m numbers), and if the two sequences meet somewhere in the middle then the sharpness condition is satisfied.
