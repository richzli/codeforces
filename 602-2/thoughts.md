## THOUGHTS

A and B were relatively easy, no problem there. I got D1 with a simple solution, but I spent way too much time writing/debugging D2. The foundation was there, but I just wasn't fast enough.

Got stumped on C. Spent a lot of time for no reason.

Maybe I'm just sleep-deprived. I've been awake for like 20 hours, lol.

Ah, darn. TLE on test 10 with my solution after, anyways. I looked at some top solutions, and they had the same idea as me, so at least I know I'm on the right track.
